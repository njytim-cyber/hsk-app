Competitive Positioning: HSK App vs SuperChinese
The Incumbent: SuperChinese
SuperChinese is the dominant Chinese learning app, backed by 12+ years of big data from Shanghai Yuxuan. Here's what they do well and where they fall short:

What They Have
Area	Details
Curriculum	HSK 1–6, 400+ lessons, 50+ thematic topics, 9 levels
AI Tutor	"Chao" — GPT-powered chatbot for corrections & conversation
Speech	Speech recognition for pronunciation practice
Content	Pre-recorded animated videos, bite-sized 10–15 min lessons
Business	Freemium + expensive AI add-on, school/corporate tiers
Their Weaknesses (Real User Pain Points)
Weakness	Source
Writing practice is minimal/absent	Consistent Reddit complaints (2024–2025)
AI (Chao) feels dated	Users report GPT 3.5-era responses, expensive add-on
Grammar explanations are vague	AI-generated, "awkward," learners seek help elsewhere
Videos are passive	Traditional animated explainer style — watch, don't participate
Slow vocabulary pacing	Words introduced too slowly for motivated learners
Translations feel robotic	"Seems like Google Translate"
Technical glitches	Lessons hang at loading, storage-heavy downloads
Our Counter-Position: Video-First Immersive Learning
SuperChinese is a 2020s textbook wrapped in an app. We are a 2026 immersion engine.

Strategic Wedge
SuperChinese: "Learn Chinese the smart way" → AI helps you study flashcards
Our app:     "Live Chinese"               → AI drops you into scenes, you perform
Where We Win
Dimension	SuperChinese	Our App
Video	Passive animated explainers	Immersive short-form video — you watch a scene, then become part of it
Writing	Almost none	Stroke-order animation + HanziWriter canvas — their #1 weakness is our built-in feature
Learning Flow	Disconnected modules	Video → Listen → Speak → Write → Reconstruct — one sentence, five skills, one flow
AI Feel	Chatbot bolted on ($$$)	AI-generated video content that feels native, not an add-on
Pacing	Slow drip, 400+ lessons	10 dense units — each one teaches a real sentence you can use today
Aesthetic	Functional/corporate	Tang Dynasty design language — cultural immersion starts at the UI
Pricing Model	Freemium + expensive AI tier	Free, open, no paywall
The 2026 Differentiator: AI Video as the Core
The industry is moving toward immersive AI-generated video for language learning. SuperChinese's videos are passive, pre-produced animations. Our architecture is built for:

AI-generated scenario videos — every lesson starts with a short video scene
Active participation — after watching, you pronounce, write, and reconstruct what you heard
Contextual vocabulary — words aren't flashcards, they're moments in a story
Progressive density — each video sentence packs 3–4 HSK target phrases
What We Already Have (Our Moat)
✅ Video lesson pipeline with full 6-stage flow (Intro → Video → Phonetic → Writing → Scramble → Complete)
✅ Explicit stage context headers driving clear "Next Action" framing
✅ HanziWriter integration with stroke-order animation preview
✅ Speech recognition for phonetic practice
✅ Sentence reconstruction (scramble) stage
✅ Premium Tang Dynasty design system (Sancai palette, frosted glass navigation, calligraphy empty states, and custom animated SVG feedback)
✅ 10 HSK 4 units with 37 target phrases
✅ 1 proof-of-concept video (坚持与成功)
What We Need Next (Roadmap Priorities)
Priority	Item	Why
🔴 P3	Generate AI videos for remaining 9 units - placeholder content is used first
🔴 P0	Polished VIDEO landing page that sells the vision	First impression = everything
🟡 P1	Progress tracking & spaced repetition	Retention loop
🟡 P1	TTS with natural voice for each sentence	Audio immersion - hook up the MS voices if not done
🟢 P2	More HSK levels (1–3, 5)	Breadth to compete
🟢 P2	Social/share features	Viral growth
One-Line Positioning
