# North Star — 6 Design Principles

> **These are NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Every task, feature, fix, and decision must be evaluated against all six.

## 1. First question in under 10 seconds
Every screen between "open" and "answer" is where we lose someone.

## 2. Never show a child they're failing
Wrong answers are information, not verdicts.

## 3. Fun first, education second
A child who closes the app learned nothing.

## 4. Rewards must match the player
Stickers for collectors, rankings for competitors, data for studiers.

## 5. Difficulty is invisible
The app feels "just right" without the child ever choosing a level.

## 6. Trust is lost in one bad question
Question quality is the product.
